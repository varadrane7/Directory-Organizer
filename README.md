# Folder Organizer

Folder Organizer is a simple Python script to sort and organize your files into respective folders.

## Description

This script uses `tkinter` to open a dialog box allowing you to select a folder to organize. After you've selected a folder, the script will create several subfolders including 'docs', 'excel', 'powerpoint', 'images', 'programs', 'compressed', and 'other'. Each file from the selected folder will then be moved into its corresponding subfolder based on the file's extension. Folders that are already existing will not be modified, and files that do not match any specific category will be moved into the 'other' folder.

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone
cd FolderOrganizer
```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine:

```bash
python --version
```

If not installed, download Python 3 from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing `script.py` in your terminal and run:

```bash
python script.py
```

A dialog box will appear. Select the folder you wish to organize and press 'OK'.
